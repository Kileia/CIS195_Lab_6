      <h2 style="text-align: left">Synopsis (ai generated)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        "Elemental" is an epic fantasy tale set in a world where the elements of
        nature hold immense power. The story follows a young protagonist who
        discovers that they possess the rare ability to control and manipulate
        multiple elements simultaneously. As they embark on a dangerous quest,
        they must learn to harness their newfound powers, navigate political
        intrigues, and confront ancient forces that threaten to plunge the realm
        into chaos. Along the way, they encounter allies and enemies, uncover
        deep secrets about their lineage, and become a pivotal figure in a war
        that will determine the fate of the elemental world. "Elemental" weaves
        together thrilling action, intricate world-building, and a protagonist's
        personal journey of self-discovery.

      <h2 class="item4">My Opinion</h2>
      <p>
        I think this movie was good, but a bit slow. The message was great, but
        there was too much back and forrth between Ember and Wade. The rejection
        from Ember was becoming too predictable and a bit dreadful. You would
        just want Ember to give in to Wade's love, but once again he would be
        rejected. Still, a very heart-warming movie to watch.
